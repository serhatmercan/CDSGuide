# CDS Guide

Welcome to the CDS Guide project! 
This repository serves as a comprehensive guide for SAP developers who want to leverage ABAP Core Data Services (CDS) for data modeling and data access layers.

## Overview

The CDS Guide project includes various examples and structures to help you understand and implement CDS views, tables, functions, and classes. The main functionalities covered in this project are:

- Data Filtering
- Data Merging
- Data Transformation
- Data Querying

## Project Structure

- **Access Control**: Implements access control mechanisms.
- **Annotation**: Defines global & local annotations used across the project.
- **Association**: Defines data associations and relationships.
- **Class**: Contains the definition and implementation of a class.
- **Condition**: Defines structures for handling conditions and conditional logic within CDS views.
- **Conversion**: Provides functions and structures for data type conversions, such as currency or unit conversions.
- **Date**: Offers built-in functions for date manipulation, such as formatting, calculations, and comparisons.
- **Extend**: Supports extending existing CDS views with additional fields, associations, or annotations.
- **Function**: Defines reusable function structures that enhance CDS logic and calculations.
- **Join**: Manages data relationships by defining different types of joins (INNER, LEFT OUTER, etc.) in CDS views.
- **Main**: Represents the primary CDS view, which acts as the foundation for data modeling and exposure.
- **Math**: Provides mathematical operations and functions for numerical calculations within CDS views.
- **OData**: Specifies how a CDS view is exposed as an OData service for external consumption.
- **Parameters**: Defines input parameters for dynamic data filtering and processing in CDS views.
- **Program**: Explains how CDS views are integrated and utilized within an ABAP program.
- **Query**: Structures data retrieval logic by defining query formats and execution rules.
- **Report**: Demonstrates how CDS views are leveraged within reporting frameworks and analytics.
- **Session**: Provides access to session-specific system parameters, such as user settings and client information.
- **String**: Handles string operations like concatenation, substring extraction, and text formatting.
- **Time**: Facilitates time-based operations, including conversions, calculations, and formatting.
- **Union**: Defines how multiple queries can be combined using UNION operations in CDS views.
